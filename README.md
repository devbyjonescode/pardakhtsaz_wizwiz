## The instructions for installing on the host, download the project through the link below

````
https://github.com/wizwizdev/wizwizxui-timebot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
````

<br>


# Important items in the host

## 1- Error 500 in cPanel host

> In the cpanel host, click on the Select PHPVersion option and activate the following options in the extension section:
- pdo_mysql
- mysqlnd
- nd_mysqli
> Disable the following options:

### If the following option is blue, please activate it:

         <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27927279/230842783-16f6d1a5-e726-4533-a57b-98cb04fa8dfc.PNG" />
     </a>
<br>
<br>

## 2- Activation of the following extensions

- soap (for the payment gateway)
- ssh2 (to back up from the panel) for some hosts, this does not exist and you cannot use the backup function
- fileinfo ( Token not found error )


<br>


## 3- Notes after installation

- After installation, be sure to completely delete the install folder and the create DB.php file inside the wizwizxui-timebot-main folder


<br>

## 4- Kronjob for the following files

- messagewizwiz.php
- rewardReport.php
- warnusers.php
- backupnutif.php

````
/usr/bin/php -q /home/wizwizro/public_html/wizwizxui-timebot-main/settings/messagewizwiz.php >/dev/null 2>&1
````


- instead of wizwizro, you should take the desired address from the host according to the image below and enter it


<p align="center">
     <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27927279/229339959-3da695e6-eee8-49b0-a520-37552d50090f.PNG" />
</p>



- You must create a separate cron job for each of the files warnusers.php - rewardReport.php - messagewizwiz.php, but it is different for the backupnutif.php file that you must do as follows


````
/usr/bin/php -q /home/wizwizro/public_html/panel_folder_name/backupnutif.php >/dev/null 2>&1
````

# Important Points

- To force lock the channel, make sure the bot is the admin of the channel and give it full admin access (tick them all)
- If you install the Vizuise panel on the host, be sure to activate the ssh2 extension to perform the backup work.
- To use the NowPayment portal, the charge amount must be above 3.5 dollars because it cannot be paid below 3.5 dollars.
- Lokishhost or Linux should not be hosted in Iran (because Telegram is restricted and censored in Iran)
- If you use trojan protocol, your x-ui panel must support trojan, otherwise your panel will have problems.
- If the remaining traffic of the service reaches one gigabyte and the remaining time reaches one day, a notification is sent to the user.
- If the user does not renew the service within 48 hours, the service deletion notification will be sent to the user and the service will be deleted.
- To create a test account, set the price to 0, each user can have a test account only once
- To use HTTP and Header in the robot, you must set the value of Header Type to http and enter the value of Host:domain.ir for the request header.
- If we use reality, after registering the plan, please edit the plan and enter the desired dest and servername value.
- If you use the tunnel, be sure to read the <a href="https://t.me/wizwizch/177">text</a> inside the channel carefully.
- If you encounter an error (your connection to the server is not established) while shopping, be sure to listen to <a href="https://t.me/wizwizch/186">Voice</a> inside the channel.
